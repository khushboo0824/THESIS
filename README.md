This master research work deals with RNA-KG a RNA centered knowledge graph developed in Anacleto lab leverged from 60 RNA cenetred documents showing interactions between different RNA molecules in a directed graph having nodes as head and tail entity and edge as the relationship. different heterogeneous link prediction methods were deployed to predict the link and perform node type classification using random forest as a classifier. the models used for the embeddings of the subgraph of RNA-KG were TRANSE, ROTATE,RDF2VEC,GATConv.
